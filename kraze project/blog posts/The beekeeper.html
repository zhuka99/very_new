    <h2>A fresh take on the John Wick formula</h2>
    <p>
      A fresh take on the John Wick formula. Ahh, the beekeeper. I went into
      this movie expecting mindless action, endless explosions, floods of
      gunfire, and one heck of a good time. But what I got was exactly that, and
      an extra bit more. Now, is this the next john wick, or die hard? Is this
      movie going to go down in history as one of the best action flicks of the
      century? Probably not. But, does it need to be? Probably not. It does a
      good job of being what it set out to be: good, mindless fun. This film
      doesn’t try to hide the fact that it’s a john wick-like, but it tweaks the
      formula just enough that it’s an enjoyable time. If you like action
      movies, you’ll like the beekeeper. If you don’t like action movies, I’d be
      curious to see if you liked this one. It isn’t so over-the-top that it
      will make you nauseous, but I’m afraid there isn’t a strong sense of
      character depth to keep you interested. It’s a stuff-happening, non-stop
      action type movie.
      <br /><br />

      What I like about this movie is how subtly memorable it is. There is
      nothing truly groundbreaking or innovative about it, but it tweaks the
      john wick formula just enough to be enjoyable. It scratches the john wick
      itch, while still feeling like something just a smidge different. But it
      got me thinking: action movies are really hard to mess up. Sure, to make
      something amazing, innovative, and groundbreaking, it will take some
      effort, but I think it’s especially hard to make an action movie that has
      audiences leaving a theater unhappy. Critics and the public at large
      aside, I think all you really need for a good action flick is gunfire,
      explosions, and a plot that moves along in a way that makes sense. I’m no
      expert, but it seems pretty simple to me as a viewer. But this movie did
      just enough to the pre-established formula of action movies to feel like
      something enjoyable, yet familiar. It got me thinking about what makes
      something memorable. I know that’s a broad question, but I noticed it in
      the early scenes introducing the main antagonist. I thought they
      established him well, and portrayed him in ways that accented a
      personality that was unoriginally memorable. I, honestly, don’t fully
      understand how that works, myself. I watched the first scene where he
      skateboards in the office in fancy clothes and acts like a jerk, and he
      felt somewhat unforgettable. And yet, at the same time, it was like I had
      seen this character a hundred times before. I liked it.
      <br /><br />
      Sometimes, movies can become memorable without being groundbreaking. Some
      of the movies I grew up on weren’t necessarily new and special, but we
      didn’t nitpick that much. That’s something we do too much of these days. I
      remember if we looked at the theater showings and didn’t see anything we
      liked, we would just do something else. Nowadays, we have to shout from
      the rooftops that everything is horrible. I, personally, don’t think
      movies suck any more than they used to. I think people are crankier than
      they used to be. So, do I recommend this movie? Sure! If you like John
      Wick, or action movies in general, this one will scratch that itch. It
      doesn’t win best wick-like, that spot still goes to “nobody,” but the
      scenes and characters are just new enough to feel like a fresh take on the
      formula. Ultimately, it’s a fun time, and even more so on a big screen.
      But I am curious to know what you think, so please let me know! Til next
      time cheers!
