      Fatherless Updated: Jan 6 Filling the hole left gaping. When I was four
      years old, my parents split up. I didn’t feel the effects immediately
      because everything around me went pretty smoothly. But, as years went by,
      I experienced a lot of chaos. I was the only single-parent household
      around, and everyone acted like it was a big deal. To me, it was just how
      things were. However, at the same time, I used to blame all my problems on
      my dad not being around. The angst that every teenager knows quite well,
      all my fears, my failures. They were all the fault of my dad who left, and
      the messed up household he left behind. As I got older, I wanted to start
      healing from the wounds my upbringing gave me. It’s a topic I have become
      passionate about. I wanted to share my journey with the world. I want to
      write about this because I feel like there’s a need not being met in the
      world. A need that ought to be met. For the longest time, every time I
      tried to find helpful advice, I was met with dead ends. I turned to
      psychology for advice, and all I found was “there is no cure for a
      fatherless upbringing.” Just what every sick child wants to hear. Maybe
      there’s more to that argument than I’m giving it credit for.After all, I’m
      not the expert, what could I possibly know? But it’s sickening to me how
      much of psychology is a bunch of wishy-washy nonsense about how we don’t
      even know where to recommend people start healing. Even if it’s just to
      get the ball rolling, give me SOMETHING to start with! I couldn’t accept
      that I was hopeless. I couldn’t accept this answer, so I kept digging. And
      digging And digging. As I desperately searched for help, something
      miraculous started happening: I started improving! I won’t sugarcoat it: I
      don’t have a ton of respect for therapy. It’s good for the extreme cases,
      but I believe a lot of work and progress can be made on your own without
      the extra bills. I’m not one of those macho “just hack it” type guys,
      either. We can all make lots of progress on our minds and our wellbeing,
      but the bills and the wishy-washy “assistance” doesn’t suit me. If the
      goal is to have me make my own decisions, what is the point in a therapist
      getting involved in the first place? I believe on a certain level, we are
      all fatherless. This is not to say that 100% of households lack the male
      parent, but rather 100% of households lack 100% of the male parent’s
      influence. In plain english, every father is human and every human is
      imperfect. We all have father wounds on some level. Whether dad missed our
      championship baseball game that made personal history, or he left when he
      found out mom was pregnant, every kid has wounds from their dads. (I mean,
      moms too, but it feels like we talk about fatherlessness more. Maybe it’s
      just because I’m male. I don’t know.) The difference between those with
      bad dads and no dads is that us dad-less kids hog the spotlight. It’s more
      visible when dad wasn’t home at all. Sir Arthur's father might be a
      workaholic that doesn’t get home until his family lays their heads to
      rest, but we give him less attention than sir Bartholomew whose father
      disappeared shortly after his son’s birth. It’s not fair. We all have
      father wounds that need healing. So, if you technically had a father that
      did nothing more than ate and slept under the same roof, stay with me.
      This advice is for you too. I want to share my insights on things that
      have worked for me. Some of it has been backed by studies from the few
      experts that had something useful to say and some of it has been personal
      experience alone. I feel confident sharing these things because I am
      functioning well in life. Am I perfect? Absolutely not! But I have a big
      network of friends, and I can honestly say that I am in a good spot in
      life. I can see the good decisions to make, and have the mental fortitude
      to make them. Basically, I’m on the ball. I hope that the insights I have
      been given benefit you as much as they have benefitted me. If nothing
      else, I hope I can at least get the conversation started. As I started my
      journey to curing fatherlessness, four major categories started emerging.
      I don’t know if everything fits neatly into these four, but the vast
      majority of things seemed to fit nicely. The real benefit, however, is
      that these four categories started to propel me forward, rather than just
      help fit all my journals into easily-titled folders. I started to see that
      I could figure out where I was lacking, holding myself accountable to grow
      in these areas.When I would find myself spiraling, I would ask myself “in
      what category am I lacking?” So far, I’ve always been able to fit it into
      one of these four: Competence Confidence Wisdom Values Competence should
      be fairly obvious. Can I change the oil in my car? Am I capable of
      throwing a punch? Can I cook a meal? Basically, can I do stuff? It’s a mix
      of practical skills and knowledge. I put them under the same roof because
      they answer the question “can I function in the world?” If you were given
      a year in this modern-day jungle of life, would you survive? Your
      competence level is how well you can do for yourself to survive. The
      beauty of this is that it’s simple to remedy. The only skill you have to
      practice is to get comfortable admitting you don’t know something. The
      better you get at this, the more comfortable you can get even going out of
      your way to figure out where you need to grow. I keep a google keep tab
      pinned to the top of my dashboard. Every time I discover something I don’t
      know much about, I jot it down.Then, I schedule some time each week to
      work on learning these skills. Even just ten minutes a week will get you
      somewhere. Heck, you could just keep one big youtube playlist so that you
      know where to go when you need a certain skill. As long as you are
      prepared to handle the situation when it arises. <br /><br />
      Confidence is how well you feel about your odds of survival. It’s the
      emotional stability in the face of opposition. Plain english: it’s feeling
      good about what you can do. You don’t need to know how to do everything to
      be on top of a situation, you just need to know what steps you need to
      take first.It’s ok not to know how to fix the problem, you just need to
      have access to the resource that does. I look at it like this: I can’t
      bench press a bus. Never have, never will. Does this bother me? No. Should
      this bother me? Also no. I’m not lazy and I’m not going to beat myself up
      for not doing more at the gym. It’s just something I’m not able to do.
      Most examples that start to bug us don’t seem as impossible, but it’s
      still unreasonable to feel bent out of shape about it. That feeling is the
      difference. The more undisturbed you are, the better. Specifically when a
      parent wasn’t there to affirm who you are, it can feel like you’re
      worthless. I still contend with that sometimes. But I have made massive
      improvements on myself because I recognized this as a category and have
      started taking action about it. I believe rituals are a big key to
      recovery. Taking some time to be intentional about recognizing that you
      have achieved something, and have made progress towards getting somewhere
      is important. I will say no more because I want to do a separate entry on
      rituals, specifically how to write your own for yourself. The point is
      parents are supposed to recognize their kids' worth. Without one parent
      there, the child doesn’t get as much recognition, which leads to problems.
      <br /><br />
      Wisdom is…well…Oh boy… <br /><br />
      There are far smarter men that have gone ‘round in circles trying to
      figure out exactly what wisdom is. We aren’t going there today. By wisdom,
      I mean how well you use what you have, and to what ends. Let’s suppose I
      have a car that starts breaking down in the middle of the highway. In my
      contacts list, I have a friend who is a mechanic, and would be willing to
      help if I needed him. In my brain, I have no certified experience with
      cars. In my passenger seat I have my mother, who I’m not too keen on
      putting in harm’s way. An UNwise decision would be to fiddle with the car
      myself. An even less wise decision would be to wait until it completely
      collapses in the middle of the road. A wise decision would be to call my
      friend or, at least, pay a visit to a trusted mechanic. You don’t have to
      have all the competencies to make a wise choice, you just need to start to
      take inventory of what you have, and to make decisions accordingly. It
      takes slowing down and thinking through your decisions a bit to start
      getting the hang of this. What has helped me grow in wisdom is to look
      back at how I have handled past situations, and see how I could have
      handled them better. This is also something I like to journal a lot about.
      Many times I don’t have to figure out what decision I should make, but I
      have some sort of mental barrier around doing it. Maybe it’s that
      masculine instinct to try to figure it out on my own, maybe it’s a
      childhood wound I haven’t tended to yet. Maybe it’s just a habit that
      needs breaking. Whatever it may be, journaling about decisions I need to
      make has helped me clear my head and make the wisest choice. What you lack
      in competence, you can make up for with a mix of confidence and wisdom.
      <br /><br />
      Values refer to the “ought’s.” I know things are more of a free-for-all
      nowadays, but certain decisions are still more moral than others. I’m not
      an expert on morality systems, but I’m pretty confident in saying that
      stealing is a worse decision than buying your own stuff. Things like fair
      play, integrity, honesty, and responsibility need to be nurtured into
      people. Without them, we make a mess of our lives. <br /><br />
      Values also refer to the ought’s of our place in the world. Whether it’s
      what it means to be a man or woman, the respect one should show for their
      elders, and so on. I like to think of values as the road to a meaningful
      life. Whereas everything else discussed so far has been about survival,
      values are about thriving. They’re about leading a life that will be
      fulfilling. Many people see these “should-be’s” as constricting. I have
      heard people say it limits their freedom, and it’s oppressive. I’ll admit
      that there is a fear in disciplining yourself, and sometimes you don’t
      immediately see the benefit compared to the thrill you may have had, but
      in the long run, good values guide one towards living a healthy life. Good
      values are not only helpful for the individual person, but for anyone they
      come in contact with. Ultimately, good values make the world a better
      place. <br /><br />
      On top of seeing the various areas in which I could grow, these categories
      have helped me compartmentalize when I am feeling bad about something.
      Instead of bashing myself over the head for some obscure fact I didn’t
      know, I have started realizing that this category is one of many. Mess ups
      have started to feel smaller because it’s one dent in one category. I
      still have a lot of things I am good at. The trick to healing parent
      wounds is to see where you are lacking in these categories, and grieve the
      loss that came with them. I have found it important to take moments to
      feel sad about how better things could have been if I had just been more
      fully developed in these areas. After this grieving process, I start
      picking myself up and developing what I’m lacking. I’ve made a lot of
      progress in my wellbeing as a person, and I have my tenacity, and my God
      to thank for that. I’ll dive into some more specific stories in due time,
      but for now the four categories are what I want to leave you with.
      <br /><br />
      Ultimately, these four categories have been my roadmap to growth and
      recovery. I’m not a perfect 10 in any of these categories, not by a
      longshot. However, it’s been a great way to assess where I need to focus
      my efforts, and to start to develop ways to grow effectively. I will be
      sharing later some of the methods I have used to grow in each of these
      categories, but for now I just want to convey that they exist. I want to
      encourage you to take these ideas and toy with them on your own. See if
      they work in your own life. If they don’t, change them some to see what
      works for you. Either way, I would love to hear your thoughts on this, and
      what you think about these insights. Until next time Go in peace.
