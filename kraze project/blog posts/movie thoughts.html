    <h2>Who I am, and who I am not</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to take a moment to share with you what I have planned for this
      category. It’s a bit of a nuanced thing, because I’m trying to do
      something a bit new. When I was planning this out, I originally took aim
      at being some sort of movie critic. I tried to rework things so I would
      have a unique angle to try to meet a certain demographic’s needs and
      whatnot. I guess, in a way, I have succeeded, but it’s an avenue so new
      that I don’t feel comfortable calling myself a movie critic at all.
      <br /><br />
      Some of you might have noticed that I have the title of “The Movie Knight”
      floating around some of my content. The original plan was to be a sort of
      frontliner, going out to see every movie to evaluate what types of morals
      and values it had to ultimately answer the question of whether or not you
      should be watching it. Although that still feels like it should be part of
      the plan, I have something a bit broader that makes a little more sense to
      me. You see, what I am doing everywhere else is taking my personal stories
      and turning them into life lessons. As I was shaping up the vision for
      this blog, I had an entire separate avenue for movie stuff and personal
      stuff. It started to become an overwhelming endeavor and I started asking
      why I should even bother. Then it dawned on me: if I can turn my own
      personal stories into life lessons, why can’t I do the same with stories
      on the big screen? That is the vision for movie thoughts. I want to take
      my understanding of what I watch and turn it into something I can convey
      to you. But, at the end of the day, I don’t have much experience or
      education in film. I’m just a random schmuck who watches a lot of movies.
      <br /><br />
      This is not to say, however, that I won’t have some interesting things to
      say. In general, I’m no dummy, so I can come up with something interesting
      worth reading. It is to say, however, that you have my permission to come
      and try to prove me wrong when you disagree with me. I’m always happy to
      have someone help me get smarter. So please, by all means, come! Let’s
      start a dialogue! But do know I am still stubborn, so I will still dig my
      heels in if I think I’m right. Either way, I’m excited to share my
      interest in movies with you, and I can’t wait to see where this leads us.
      Til next we meet May peace be with you.
