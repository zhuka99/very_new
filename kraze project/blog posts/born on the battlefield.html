    <h1 class="blogtitle">Born on the Battlefield</h1>
    <p>
      To be born into war is to forget why war began Jesus always reminded His
      followers to count the cost of following Him. Missionaries are no
      exception. I know our parents counted the cost, and I do not doubt that
      they paid it gladly to be able to follow Jesus. Yet, sometimes we kids
      didn’t get it. Sometimes, it looked like we were paying for a price tag
      sticker with no item. All we knew was the draining of our wallets. We
      didn’t understand the mission we were paying for with our sacrifice.
      Sometimes we are called to step into a decision we don’t like, but I don’t
      believe God simply leaves us out in the cold. I don’t think very many of
      us understood what the precious pearl worth everything was. We simply felt
      overwhelmed by the struggle. Believe me, I get it. I fought with it for
      years. I still do sometimes. But God is bigger than it all.
      <br /><br />I believe He is the great healer, and no heart is too sick for
      Him to replenish. My heart goes out daily for those I fought and bled
      alongside over the years. So many fallen soldiers, so many wounded
      comrades, so much darkness. I can barely even talk about it without
      getting a little stirred up. All I want is to bring some hope back. I want
      people to believe that God is alive, roaring like a lion. And, if He can
      work in me, there isn’t a single one of you that’s too far gone. The point
      of this section is to tell my stories, and highlight the things I have
      learned and done to be able to make it home. I don’t believe I did it in
      my own strength, so I will preface everything I say with a charge to pray
      about it. I did, however, find a few tips and tricks that have propelled
      me towards Christ, and recovery from some of His…more zealous fans. As
      time passes, I can understand more and more of where they all came from,
      so I’m going to do my best to be light on the bashing. I’m not here to
      start wars, I’m just here to tell my story, and what God has made of me.
      All I want to do is tell my stories, and what I have since learned from
      them. <br /><br />I will try to scatter this throughout, but I do want it
      to be made clear that I am open to being wrong. If you want to offer me
      correction, I welcome and cherish it! I know I have rustled some feathers
      doing this type of thing before, but I promise to try to be a little more
      sparing with the harsh words. I can’t guarantee that it will never happen
      (after all, a knight doesn’t grab his armor and sword just for show,) but
      it will be a little more deliberate and calculated. My prayer is that you
      are able to chew on what I have to say. These can be tough stories to hear
      sometimes. To some, these stories will be cathartic. To others, these
      stories can be tough, because it will push on the black-and-white nature
      of people. Many want to believe that Christians are the good guys, and
      everyone else are the bad guys. Unfortunately, I will be pushing back on
      that idea, but also showing how I have come full circle. I still don’t
      agree with some of the ways things went, but I have reconciled enough to
      be able to understand where everyone was coming from. Honestly, I often
      find myself agreeing with the founding principles, just not how they were
      executed. Anyway, I do hope this section helps to enrich your faith and
      your walk with Christ. And, as always, I am always available if you want
      to discuss these things further. Thank you for taking the time to read my
      blog, and I look forward to seeing your comments.Until next we meet May
      peace be with you.
