    <h2>Surviving the onslaught of failures</h2>
    <p class="body">
      What do you do when you’re in the middle of a meltdown? When you’re faced
      with failure after failure and all you can do is collapse into a chair and
      shout “this just isn’t my day!” I’ll be honest, I’m in the middle of one
      of those right now. As of this moment, today has gone pretty rotten.
      Something set me off this morning, and the rage has sent me racing down
      the hill of dark feelings. What do you do when those moments come? When it
      feels like every attempt to fix it is making things worse and worse? What
      do you do in those moments?
      <br />
      <br />
      The answer isn’t easy. The answer isn’t clean-cut. Sometimes, like with me
      today, it starts early. By 9:00 AM I was ripe with malicious anger for
      everything that got in my way. I had to hack it through the day. I’m not a
      fan of the whole “treat yourself” mantra, so making this an excuse to
      drown myself in sweets isn’t an option. So, what I propose is to just say
      screw it. Sometimes you have to crumple up the fragile, paper-like day you
      are having, and try again tomorrow. It doesn’t mean you’re a failure, it
      doesn’t mean you’re losing time, you’re just punching that reset button
      for a better shot at your goals. Sometimes a little time to rest and get
      refocused is all you need. You have to get your head out of the game to
      have a better, fresher head in it. Maybe you need to give up the fight for
      the night and go to bed early. Maybe you just need a quick break to get
      some air. Maybe you need a change of routine somehow. Whatever you can
      take, take it. But I’m notsaying you should just collapse and leave it
      there. Oh no no
      <br />
      <br />
      no! You wish you could have it that easy! What I’m saying is get a
      breather so you can come back and finish the fight. The project must get
      done, the relationship must be mended, and the moods must bounce back.
      Never make a decision in the heat of anger, but never put off making a
      decision indefinitely. Take a break, get a good night’s sleep, then come
      back and vanquish your foes!
      <br />
      <br />
      While you are in the heat of failure, I have found it productive to get to
      know it. You can heal a symptom, but if you don’t heal the underlying
      cause, you can’t truly say you’ve fixed the problem. I have made my
      greatest breakthroughs on myself as I have put myself under intense
      pressure. That’s why I put myself through intense challenges: I get to
      know what’s in my head. When I started taking cold showers, I learned what
      drives me, what makes me quit, why I get back up, how to get back up. The
      more intense the bad day, the more you should dig, asking yourself
      questions like why you are feeling this way? Why are you here in the first
      place? What is driving you to keep going? It may go back to a life pattern
      you are repeating. There may be other factors at play that you weren’t
      realizing. It may be some old wound you never took the time to heal. Of
      all the things that have helped me grow this year, intense pressure has
      been my biggest factor.
      <br />
      <br />
      But how do I go about studying myself? How do I get started with this
      process of healing whatever negative nonsense is going on in my brain? I
      do a lot of journaling. When journaling, I usually start with the facts.
      “I woke up. Wanted to go back to bed. It was all downhill from there.” As
      you relay the facts, ask the “why’s.” “I woke up and didn’t want to get
      out of bed because I had a breakup yesterday.” (Please don’t send me
      ‘sorry’ texts, I didn’t actually have a breakup.) See if there are any
      more. Breakups suck, but they can be a piece of a bigger picture. “I had a
      breakup, she treated me the way my mom treated me as a kid.” Ouch! Learn
      to get to know yourself. Take some time to learn this skill. It takes
      practice. You may not have much to write for a while, but the more you do
      this, the more it will come naturally.
      <br />
      <br />
      My prayer for you is that you master the art of the reset button. I pray
      you use every opportunity to better understand yourself, and to bring a
      decluttering to your mind. After all, there is nowhere we spend more time
      in than our own minds, so best make sure they are in the most excellent of
      conditions. Until next we meet Cheers!
