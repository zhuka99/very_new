    <h2>A fresh take on the John Wick formula</h2>
    <p>
      As I was preparing to start blogging, I originally had four distinct
      categories, and an “everything else” box. However, one night I was at my
      usual bible study, and I was feeling a bit lost. “God, what am I doing
      here?” I prayed. I felt a little nudge on my side as I heard the words
      “open a new category.” I chewed on the idea a little bit,I figured it
      meant something about diving into deeper depths of God’s word and knowing
      Him better. So, I went home with this newfound revelation, and was struck
      like lightning with another revelation: all my blog posts are organized
      into categories! Two-and-two weren’t coming together quick enough, so I
      kept praying about it. As I was listening to the newsboys, I heard a line
      that stopped me dead in my tracks (quite literally. I have this weird
      pause-gap in my journal. It’s funny looking.) “Make way for the King!” was
      the line. My mind immediately tied this to John the Baptist, who paved the
      way for the coming of Jesus. My mind kept racing Then pausing
      <br /><br />Then racing again. <br /><br />
      It was an adventure, to say the least. To sum up, this section is just
      going to be my spiritual journey as it unfolds. I’m no preacher, so I hope
      I don’t come across like I know everything (in fact, I’m fighting myself
      to even post something like this at all. I mean, what do I know about
      anything?) If nothing else, it’s weird seeing how much like “that guy” I
      sound. I say it’s weird, because if you knew me growing up, I was
      definitely not “that guy.” <br /><br />I do try to be wise about how I
      sound, because I don’t want to be written off by those that matter, but I
      do feel a space for this might be interesting. I guess we are going to
      find out. What’s the worst that can happen? I hope this can enrich your
      life, and that maybe we can have a dialogue or two. I like to grow, and to
      connect with people doing so. Who knows where this road will lead.
      Sometimes, the best thing to do is to simply step out of the boat. Cheers!
